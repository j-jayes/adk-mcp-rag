    "text": "Comments\n\nThis recipe features a vinaigrette that I love to use. It’s awesome\nI tried this recipe but I couldn’t find radicchio anywhere. I made the salad with arugula instead and would 100% recommend this veggie if you cant find radicchio either. Very good recipe and easy to follow.\nI’m not sure if this review will make it. But I am so tired of reading reviews of recipes that don’t follow the recipe or use the ingredients. Then, giving it a bad rating. What’s next, a vegan reviewing a recipe for steak au poivre, subbing tofu, then complaining the dish was bland derp 2 stars.\nSoaking the radicchio leaves in Icy water for a few hours will take away the bitterness. The recipe could use some weights and measures.\nMade this salad four times now! and it never fails to impress!\nThis is a very good salad and visually stunning. I added some fun leaf lettuces to break up the bitter from the radicchio and it made it even prettier. I also added mint, which was bomb.\nThe dressing for this is MONEY. It should be bottled for sure. The radicchio is too bitter for my liking. The squash is good. All the toppings are good. I’d love to make it again but the radicchio has got to go. There has to be another leafy veg that could work for this.\nI made this for thanksgiving this year! It made A LOT of salad - absolutely filled up a large platter. The majority of feedback I received was that it was “beautiful” - which is nice to hear, and I agreed! I found the radicchio to be a little bitter for my tastes, but it was a nice contrast to all the creamy, umami bombs of thanksgiving. There’s really no way to get an 898 squash, as far as Google and I could tell - so I used some delicata and some butternut, cubed up. The different colors (yellow and orange respectively) were very pretty and they tasted wonderful - but I wish there was some way to quantify how much should be used (oz or lbs would work!)? I might try this again for a dinner party - it HAS inspired me to look at radicchio and winter squash in salads, which is a nice change!\nI was very excited to try making this salad after watching the new Making Perfect series! Right off the bat I need to say that this review is not 100% accurate to the original recipe because I could not find 898 or honeynut squash, Piave, or radicchio. I used delicata squash, Parmesan cheese, and a mix of shredded cabbage, broccoli, and brussel sprouts instead. I also wanted to make salads as lunch salads instead of a side, so I added in some shrimp to make it more of a meal. I hadn’t used delicata squash before and they were….okay. I thought they were pretty bland for what is supposed to be a squash-centric salad. I wish the recipe had said how much salt and pepper to add, since you can’t exactly taste and adjust the seasoning on raw squash, so mine were bland when they came out of the oven, but once I added more salt and pepper they tasted okay. They did get brown on the bottoms, especially the squash on the lower oven shelf. The dressing was very tasty if a little thick and labor intensive. When eating the final salad, I thought the Parmesan got lost with all of the other flavors. I even added more partway through eating it, but I still didn’t notice it. Maybe Piave brings more to the party. Overall, the salad was pretty tasty, but I’m not sure if it’s worth all the work to make it again. I’m also disappointed that I couldn’t find three of the ingredients in an average grocery store. If I could find them, I might try making the salad again. I made salads in the past with roasted butternut squash and brussel sprouts, feta, shredded chicken, walnuts, pomegranate seeds, and a pomegranate vinaigrette which I thought were more tasty and less work, so I would probably make that instead if I were craving a squash salad.\nMade this recently and really enjoyed it, the dressing in particular was very tasty - thick, so you do benefit from dressing the leaves and the squash separately. I think you’d crush everything otherwise. The one thing though - I did NOT like the skin left on the squash. It was noticeably present even after roasting for a good long time, and everyone ended up just sort of scraping the squash out of the skin and eating it that way instead (and I used the prescribed honeynut, not delicata) Next time I’d definitely remove it and roast without.\nCan anyone tell me the approximate weight of the delicate squash for this salad? I am finding that they vary and “6” is throwing me off. Thanks.\nThis is a great dish–crisp, bright autumn flavors. My only issue was the dressing comes out very thick because of pecans ground into the emulsion. This makes the dressing difficult to mix into vegetables. You can thin with oil or water, but then need to season it again because that dilutes the flavor.\nSorry if this is an unfathomly dumb question but are you supposed to leave the skin on and eat it? I roasted some honeynuts and found the skin quite tough! Or is the skin just for presentation?\nMade this salad this past weekend and it was a HIT!!!! Beyond delicious! and that pecan dressing, was the boooomb!! Thank you for sharing!"

    "text": "Comments\n\nDeserving of all 5 stars. Absolutely! Delicious! I even went back for a 3rd helping. So lemony - cheesy - and peppery! What intrigued me about this dish was sauteing the entire lemon… I’ve never heard of that. I tweaked the recipe by adding red pepper flakes to the lemon butter sauce … might as well add some heat if you are going to douse it with copious amounts of pepper…then at the end I added fresh parsley and basil from my herb garden. Wooza…it was fantastic. My husband and I entertain a lot and we will judge a new recipe based on if it’s company worthy. It is! I used regular lemon since my grocery store didn’t offer a Myer’s lemon. For the people who said t was bitter - please try again - you might have had a bad lemon. It’s worth the extra effort of one more time.\nLoved this dish! I used rigatoni since that was all that was available, but it worked perfectly. I didn’t blanch the lemon like others recommended, I just sliced it super thinly (like 3–5mm) and made sure to remove all the seeds. I also removed the softened lemon slices about a minute before the butter had browned. Everything turned out great, and I loved the zing of the lemon and the sharp flavor from the black pepper paired with the buttery, salty sauce. 10/10 recommend\nMeh. It was fine. Not awful. But not really worth the effort at all. Didn’t give me more nuance than I would have gotten from simple buttered pasta topped with Parmesan.\noperator error, i’m sure. but where/how/why, i’m not sure. i essentially had soup made out of a stick of butter, thinly sliced lemon, and too much (but the called-for amount) of the pasta water. hoping against logic, i added the parm–maybe IT would thicken it up? nope. wth, i dumped the pasta in & slurped it up anyway. the flavors were heavenly, how could they not be? butter, chz, and lemon! but i truly would’ve liked a successful execution of the recipe–i’m a pretty good cook. ah, ya can’t always get it right!\nMade this last night for a special Sunday Dinner and it was D-lish! I modified the recipe just a tad by using Lobster Ravioli and adding garlic shrimp to the final product, I used Meyer Lemons, removed ALL seeds, Kerrygold Butter for the best butter flavor and squeezed an additional reg lemon into the sauce just prior to serving, garnished with chives. Zero bitterness, just sublime savory lemon buttery sauce which we both loved and would serve to company which is our barometer, would we serve this to company? A very hearty yes sir on this one. Served w/grilled garlic bread on side to wipe out the bowl because it was that tasty. Wish this review system allowed me to post my finished product pics of the dish with my mods. We really loved it and encourage you to try it too.\nI’ve made this a few times and love it. I use regular lemons and because we both love lemon, I use a whole lemon for the 2 of us. So simple and delicious.\nReally tasty! After reading the reviews, I wasn’t sure what to expect. I used a regular lemon and added a little honey when I caramelized the lemons. I probably didn’t cook enough pasta because I had a lot of sauce. However, that worked well with my dinner of steamed broccoli and baked salmon (with lemon). We were able to add some sauce on the broccoli and salmon. My husband liked it too, so I’ll make it again\nI you, like me, can’t decide between the Meyer lemon and the regular lemon based on the discussion in the reviews, I went with a Meyer lemon and even though I didn’t follow the recipe to the “T”, I really enjoyed the dish. If you’re on the fence about whether to make this dish or not, I would say don’t. It’s just pasta in a lemony-cheesy-peppery sauce, very delicious but not worth all the discussion in the comment section.\nThis was a nice surprise and I really enjoyed the flavors. Added some toasted hazelnuts for my second serving which added a nice additional texture. I think I will also try some fresh parsley\nThis was really quick and easy for a lazy weeknight meal. I only used half a box of pasta but wish I had used the entire lemon and stick of butter, the sauce turned out so delicious. Don’t worry about finding a Meyer lemon! Those who found this to be bitter, I urge you to retry and make sure to remove every single lemon seed. Will make many times over!\nHi! I have a bunch of lemon that have been zested, can i use them for this recipe? Thanks!\nEchoing Jill from Ontario! This was not at all what I expected. Really bitter and not creamy at all.\nthis recipe was suuuuper bitter. i used normal lemon which i think was the problem, if you make this i would recommend either using a meyer lemon, or if you use regular, maybe add some sugar when caramelizing ?\nPEFECT marriage of flavors\nDidn’t turn out great. Next time I’ll play with the timing of the butter browning and adding the lemon to see if I can alter the flavor a bit. Overall, a tangy (and sadly bitter) version of a cacio e pepe."

    "text": "Comments\n\nIt turned out very well; moist, and very flavourful - tastes like olive oil. But, it did brown quite a bit, so next time I make it I would cover it half way through\nI used gluten free baking flour and it worked great! I used lemoncello as the liquor and added powdered sugar, cardamom, and lemon zest on top. It was delicious! Love how versatile this cake is, and it was on the easier side!\nI messed up this recipe at literally every step and it still came out good. I was in a rush to bake a quick snacking cake to have with my coffee this morning so I didn’t read through the instructions. Ingredients are usually listed in order of use but they are not here, so pay attention to the instruction.I combined the sugar with the dry ingredients, cutting it back to 3/4C because I didn’t want it super sweet. Then I realized I was going to be whipping my eggs and needed the sugar for that. Oops🤦‍♀️ I used the remaining 1/4c of sugar with the eggs. I added the lemon zest at the end because I didn’t see I was supposed to put it in with the eggs.And finally I left the oven on 400F for half the baking time and then realized I was supposed to lower it to 350F. So the last 20 minutes were at 350. It is definitely a bit dark on the bottom but still quite tasty. I don’t have a springform pan but was able to easily invert the cake out from a regular cake pan and flip it back rightside up onto the cooling rack.All that messing up and it is still tasty! Exactly what I was in the mood for. I’m going to make a fresh cranberry sauce to go with it later. Not adding the extra oil on top because I don’t think it needs it. Next time I’ll do all the steps right and cut the sugar back some.\nFirst time making a cake that sounded odd but I became an instant fan. I used fresh squeezed orange juice and zest, amaretto, Grand Marnier and cardamon. Delish!!!\nDo we have to replace the 3 tbsp of Grand Marnier with another liquid if we dont want to use any alcohol in the cake?Can’t wait to try this!\nI used AP flower, cornmeal, 1 tablespoon less of sugar, and brandy, it is very good. The type of cake to enjoy with a cappuccino. I will try next time with orange peel and orange juice instead of lemon.\nFollowed the recipe exactly, with excellent results! I overbaked a tad (43 minutes) but the inside is still super moist. My only suggestion would be to up the citrus a bunch, more like 2 tablespoons of lemon zest or adding orange zest in addition. It was really delicious, and the texture and height of the cake was amazing.\nFollowed the recipe exactly. I used grand marnier and meyer lemons. The cake finished at exactly 40 minutes with a great crust and an incredibly moist and dense inside. Finished with confectioners sugar on top.\nBeautifully flavourful, moist cake. Needs to be covered in the oven after about 15 mins, as long cooking time can cause excessive browning, or even slight burning on top.\nDelicious cake! Used Grand Marnier, and cornmeal. I made two cakes at once the first time, and the batter was runny and both cakes sank in the middle (however the texture of the cake did not suffer… it was not more dense in the center. I think the fault lies in having to beat the eggs a little longer than 3 minutes)That being said, I’ve tried making the cake on its own the very next day because I am obsessed with perfecting this beautiful cake! Found the previous batch a little sweet so for 1 cake, used 1/2 cup sugar, beat the eggs double the recommended amount in my stand mixer, streamed the oil extra slowly with a squeeze bottle (almost drop by drop) and the batter was of a better consistency. And it did not sink! Yay! Added some lemon juice in the olive oil drizzle post bake and it makes a difference. So delicious. I also dusted with a generous layer of icing sugar and a rosemary garnish for a beautiful presentation. A must-try, not-too-sweet, refined dessert that will please a large group\nI was wondering where I could find nutrition facts? Delicious cake.\nBeautiful and delicious cake! Made with regular AP flour and turned out fine. Served with roasted plums which was a good combo!\nThis cake was a big hit with my humans! I have digestion issues with butter, so I’m always happy to find delicious butter-less recipes. I used corn meal (allergic to almonds) and Cointreau. For the oil final drizzle, I mixed in a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice to amp up the citrus flavor. It worked really well. I’m going to make this again when the it’s blood orange season — I think that will be delicious, too.\nSO GOOD!! It tastes like a pound cake, with a lighter texture and LOVELY crust. I was worried about doing everything perfect, getting every flavor right but as a very beginner baker, I can say it turned out good. It is a perfect cake to experiment with flavor too- I served it with raspberries and mint, sprinkled with powdered sugar- so so good.\nJust based on the smell in the house and other reviews, I know this cake is going to be delightful! The anticipation of waiting until tomorrow is almost too much!"

Tear off and discard stems of 1½ lb. crimini or button mushrooms, then tear them into quarters (or in halves if small). Transfer to a medium bowl. Lightly smash and peel 6 garlic cloves, then thinly slice. Peel and finely chop 2 medium shallots. (A small red onion will work fine in a pinch.) Coarsely chop 1 cup parsley leaves with tender stems.\nWhisk 5 large egg yolks, 1 large whole egg, 4 oz. store-bought pre-grated Parmesan (about 1¼ cups), and 1½ tsp. freshly ground black pepper in another medium bowl; set aside.\nHeat a large Dutch oven over medium-high for a good 3 minutes. You want to get the pan very hot since adding the mushrooms is going to lower the temperature of the surface of the pan. Toss mushrooms and ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil once in pan to coat in oil. Cook, tossing once every 4–5 minutes (but mostly undisturbed), until mushrooms are mostly golden brown, 13–16 minutes. This will take some time and they will let out a lot of moisture before they start to brown, so stick with it!\nOnce mushrooms have been cooking for about 10 minutes, drop 1 lb. orecchiette into boiling salted water and set a timer 2 minutes shy of al dente according to package directions.\nBack to those mushrooms! Once you’ve finished the browning process, reduce heat to medium-low and add garlic, shallots, and 1½ tsp. salt. Cook, stirring often, until aromatics are softened but not browned, 30–60 seconds.\nWhen pasta is 2 minutes shy of al dente, scoop out 2 cups pasta cooking liquid, then drain pasta.\nAdd pasta along with 1 cup pasta cooking liquid to mushroom mixture. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring often to finish cooking the pasta and absorb liquid, about 2 minutes (this is why you’re cooking the pasta 2 minutes shy of al dente; it allows for the flavors to meld as the pasta finishes cooking in the sauce). Remove from heat and let cool 1 minute. (Don’t skip this step—if the pasta is too hot when you add the egg mixture, it will turn into scrambled eggs instead of a luxurious sauce.)\nAdd ½ cup pasta cooking liquid to reserved egg mixture and whisk to combine and loosen eggs. Gradually add egg mixture to pot, stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon and adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed to loosen things up, until a very creamy, luscious sauce coats all noodles.\nAdd parsley and stir again to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning for salt.\nDivide pasta among bowls. Top with Parmesan and a few cranks of pepper."

(The medium bowl is for your meatball mixture, and the small bowl is for your salsa verde, in case this part seems silly.)\nFinely chop 2 cups mixed herbs. As we mentioned in the ingredients list, you can use any combo of soft herbs like parsley, dill, basil, and/or cilantro, but if you’ve only got one that’s cool, too—we just love how green and complex they taste when mixed together. Transfer half to same medium bowl, then transfer remaining herbs to same small bowl.\nFinely chop 3 Tbsp. capers. Transfer 2 Tbsp. capers to medium bowl, then transfer remaining 1 Tbsp. capers to small bowl. Chop ¼ cup walnuts and add to same medium bowl. If you’ve never added nuts to meatballs, you’re in for a real treat; they lend great texture and flavor to the finished dish.\nWhisk in 1 egg, 1 Tbsp. paprika, 2 tsp. salt, and 1 Tbsp. oil to bowl with walnuts.\nUsing clean hands, mix 1 cup panko into egg mixture. Add 1 lb. ground beef and continue to mix gently with your hands until incorporated, but do not overmix. This part is key—if you work the mixture too much, the meat will become tough and springy, almost like sausage, so use a gentle hand. Also: At this point, you can pinch off a little piece of the meatball mixture, crisp it in a skillet, and give it a taste to make sure the seasoning is to your liking. This is your last chance to make any tweaks before they all get cooked!\nDrizzle 2 Tbsp. oil on a rimmed baking sheet. Roll beef mixture into 1½” balls (about the size of golf balls). Arrange 1” apart on pan.\nBake meatballs, shaking pan halfway through, until crispy on all sides, about 10 minutes. One cool thing about using all beef (instead of a beef-pork-veal combo) is that it’s totally fine if the meatballs are a little pink in the middle.\nWhile meatballs are cooking, you can finish that salsa verde. This is one of our all-time favorite sauces, and is delicious spooned over just about any piece of meat, roasted veg, or bowl of leftovers you can think of. Which is all to say: Get ready to have a lot more salsa verde in your life from here on out. Finely grate lemon zest into bowl with herbs and garlic. Halve the lemon you just zested and squeeze juice into bowl, using your hand to catch any seeds. (You can use a citrus squeezer for this if you’ve got one.) Add remaining ½ cup oil and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper, taste, and add more seasoning if necessary—it should be good and punchy.\nTransfer meatballs to a platter, and serve with salsa verde alongside."

    "text": "Comments\n\nI plan to add pine nuts, because I have them to my lamb meatballs along with cilantro, mint and possibly dill. They sound great.\nThese turned out great, and were fast to make! Because of nut allergies, subbed pepitas for the walnuts. The bit of crunch were a welcome addition to the meatballs. We used the salsa on some other smoked meats, it seems to work with everything.\nSuper delish. Made them with lamb and pepitas (pumpkin seeds) with cilantro, mint, parsley and dill….wow!\nQuestion - is this made with raw walnuts or roasted?\nI’m on a bit of a meatball kick after making Molly’s Mojo Meatballs several times this summer (I definitely recommend those as well). These meatballs crispy, moist, and flavorful. I swap the capers for olives because it’s what I have in the fridge usually. I’ve used different combinations of herbs every time and they are always great. Most recently I made them with parsley, basil, and dill, served with the salsa verde as well as harissa potatoes from the Ottolenghi Simple cookbook.\nThese were super yummy especially with the salsa verde. Omitted the walnuts because of a nut allergy in the family. Seemed like a lot of work for something that is basically more of a heavy hor d’oeuvres than dinner, but it would be worth making for a party if you prepared them ahead of time.\nI’ve made these twice now during the pandemic and they’re just awesome. Pair it with some fresh arugula and BOOM. Only suggested edit: 1tsp of salt rather than 2. Much more palatable. Also careful with the chopping. I will always remember this salsa verde because I lost just a little bit of my pointer finger while furiously chopping :)\nMade these yesterday with ground turkey and they did not disappoint! I also only cilantro and basil, and followed the rest of the recipe pretty close to exact (changes: added a little cumin and smoked paprika in addition to regular paprika, and a sprinkle of TJs umami seasoning). The salsa was actually so great and we had no leftovers. Served this with some basmati rice on the side and a whole bunch of roasted veg. Would try this again!\nLoved this. Easy and delicious. I’m making the dish again this weekend. The Salsa Verde could easily become a staple.\nIncredible. I know it’s sacrilege but I prefer these to the meatballs that I would make in my Italian Sunday sauce. The sauce compliments excellently but they work surprisingly well in a tomato sauce as well! Love the addition of the capers and walnuts — just make sure to finely chop both.\nLoved it! These were a hit with my family of meatball lovers. They were sceptic about the capers but came around after trying them.\n1000% would make it again. The green herby sauce is NOT optional. The meatballs on their own are meh really but that Verde. I will make it again and again and again.\nI didn’t have panko and subbed with oats instead, and it seemed to be fine. The sauce could use more lemon juice. I made these on the stovetop and it turned out okay!\nMy sister made these a few weeks ago, and they were incredible. I couldn’t stop eating them before dinner. We added a few spices but pretty much stuck to the recipe. I still think about how delicious they were. Even the smell on its own was amazing.\nSimply amazing. Dynamic flavors. Capers are now a pantry staple."

    "text": "Comments\n\nThis salad was good, but the dressing was bland, which resulted in a dish that was tasty but not particularly unique. We enjoyed the texture and creativity of the raw broccoli and cabbage, but it tasted more like lemon/oil than caesar. If I make it again, I would make the dressing with another recipe.\nExcellent! Thank you! i did use less lemon juice than recommended the 2nd time I made it.\nThis was just… ok.\nI have made this several times as written and it’s great. I crave it. It gets better the longer it sits and is great to take to work for lunches. The most recent time I’ve made it I adapted it to what I had on hand - broccoli and green cabbage; added cauliflower that needed using plus carrot shaved with a peeler and thin-sliced red bell pepper because they’re pretty and why not. The dressing is delicious the way ranch is delicious because it’s really versatile.\nI had really high hopes because of the reviews–this salad was good but not amazing. It seemed a little overly oily/lemony to me. If I make it again, I may modify the recipe. It did stay crunchy for a long time and I agree, it was better the longer it sat.\nThis salad is super good. It’s turned me on to broccoli again. Takes a little time to cut up all the broccoli but worth it and makes a good amount and as other have said, it keeps well. Definitely a keeper.\nThis is really, really, really good. Stays crunchy for-ev-er. Everyone loved it. Will absolutely make again.\nLooks great but a bit confused on the directions, is there a typo? “Cut off florets as close to the dark green flowers as possible and break into bite-size pieces. Add to bowl with dressing. Starting at the floret ends of the stems, slice very thinly crosswise and add to bowl.”\nFinally, I’m getting enough salad in my diet! This salad is just as good on day three as it was on the first go. Even already dressed! I’ve passed the recipe on to others, and it’s become their go-to salad as well. To whomever came up with this… THANK YOU!\nsoo yummmm, threw some fresh snap peas into the mix and thought it was delicious. I might use more chovy and less lemon next round though.\nThis was a big hit at our Thanksgiving dinner - it even turned one guest that was not a broccoli fan into a broccoli lover who took home the leftovers to enjoy! Another winner, Chris Morocco!\nI am in love with this simple raw recipe. I used veganiase rather than mayonnaise and skipped the cabbage entirely. What a great way to get cruciferous vegetables into a meal. Satisfied my crunchy, salty. garlic cravings all at one and I’m not pregnant lol!\nI love caesar salad and this was delicious!! I did add croutons though…\nThis is really really good!\nI hate most salads, but I will make anything that Chris Morocco recommends. Super good, especially if you let it rest for a while before cramming your face. I think I just ate about a pound of broccoli."

Set aside ½ cup toasted coconut for the coconut caramel.\nPulse graham crackers, sugar, salt, and remaining ¾ cup toasted coconut in a food processor until crackers are coarsely ground. With the motor running, stream in butter, followed by yolk. Do not overprocess; you should have fine crumbs that are the texture of wet sand.\nTransfer mixture to pie dish and press firmly and evenly up sides and across the bottom. Place pan on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until crust is set and edges are brown, 12–18 minutes. Let cool.\nDo Ahead: Crust can be baked 1 day ahead. Let cool, wrap in plastic, and store at room temperature, or freeze up to 2 weeks.\nSprinkle a thin, even layer of sugar into a small heavy saucepan. Cook, undisturbed, over medium heat until mostly melted, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle another layer of sugar over and cook, stirring to incorporate granular sugar into melted sugar with a heatproof spatula, until melted, another minute or so. Repeat until you’ve used all sugar. Continue to cook, swirling saucepan (do not stir), until caramel is dark amber, about 30 seconds longer. Remove from heat and carefully pour in cream, stirring to combine (caramel will sputter and seize up, but don’t worry).\nReturn saucepan to low heat and cook, stirring, until any hardened bits of caramel are dissolved. Stir in oil until mixture is smooth, then fold in salt and reserved ½ cup toasted coconut. Let caramel cool in pan, then scrape into cooled crust and use an offset spatula to spread in an even layer. Cover with plastic and chill.\nDo Ahead: Caramel can be made 4 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and chill. Rewarm over low heat before pouring into pie crust.\nPlace oil in a medium bowl and set a fine-mesh sieve over top; set aside. Scrape vanilla seeds into a heavy medium saucepan. Add vanilla pod and coconut milk. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until coconut milk is reduced to about 1 cup, 10–15 minutes. Add half-and-half and bring to a gentle simmer.\nMeanwhile, briskly whisk egg, yolks, cornstarch, salt, and ½ cup sugar in another medium bowl until pale and thick, about 1 minute. Whisking constantly, slowly pour about ½ cup hot milk mixture into egg mixture. Go back to whisking milk mixture in saucepan, then slowly pour tempered egg mixture into saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until foam has subsided and custard holds the marks of the whisk, about 2 minutes.\nImmediately scrape custard into sieve and use a spatula to press mixture into bowl with oil; pluck out vanilla pod. Whisk strained custard until oil is incorporated and mixture is glossy and smooth.\nSet bowl inside another large bowl of ice water. Whisk occasionally until custard is cool, about 3 minutes. Scrape custard into chilled pie crust and smooth top. Press a piece of plastic directly onto surface of custard to prevent a skin from forming, and chill until set, at least 3 hours.\nUsing an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat cream in a large bowl until soft peaks form. Whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.\nRemove plastic from surface of pie and dollop cream over set custard. Top with coconut flakes.\nDo Ahead: Pie can be filled with custard 1 day ahead. Wrap in plastic and chill. Top with whipped cream and toasted coconut just before serving."

    "text": "Comments\n\nYummmm. This pie was heavenly! I followed the recipe with no substitutions, and had no troubles with the caramel. Fairly experienced home baker, with no formal training. Like a lot if bon appetit recipes, you have to tap into your foundations knowledge (although Claire provides pretty clear instructions in this one). Tip for the caramel- try letting the heavy cream come up to room temp before adding it, it won’t seize up the sugar as much and will blend in easier with less heat, which will keep the caramel from being overcooked and burnt tasting or hard. Like others noticed, the coconut flavor in the cream layer was mild, but I loved that because it let the salty, coconutty, caramel and crust shine. I think the light whipped cream was the right choice, as a heavy, sweet meringue would have been a lot. I’ll find something else for those egg whites :)\nAre you able to convert your measurements and temperatures for australian measurements? This cake looks.awesome!\nMy family loves this recipe, and I make it for my husband’s birthday every year. It’s delicious.\nI have had this recipe set aside for several years, but finally decided to make it for Thanksgiving. The results were perfect. The crust eats more like a semi-crunchy coconut cookie. You can pick up this piece of pie with your fingers and eat like a piece of pizza. I actually loved that. The caramel portion came out perfect. It was on the soft chewy side - I noticed that it blended into the crust and/or was moistened by the cream filling. Certainly if you overcook caramel, it will either turn to be like hard candy OR it will be burned. Love the light texture change and flavor addition there. *I added about 3 TBL of toasted unsweetened coconut flakes on top of the caramel layer. Turned out to be genius for extra flavor. I actually made two pies, one with whipped cream and one with toasted Italian Meringue. I loved them both.\nThis pie is fantastic! Takes a while to put together and lots of steps, but worth every minute you’ll spend on not. The only problem is the caramel. Made as directed it isn’t enough and it gets so hard on the bottom of the pie, you can’t cut it. I recommend more caramel and more cream in that caramel, so it’s not so hard. I make one cup of sugar, melted in 1/4 cup of water. Cooked to a golden brown, then 1/2 cup of heavy cream, 2 tbsp of coconut oil, and the toasted coconut. Delicious, and cuttable! I don’t use all of that caramel in the pie. It’s too much. But it’s delicious on ice cream, or in any place you might like a coconutty caramel sauce.\nI love it! I made it yesterday in 8 cm tart rings because I want to send it to my friends for the New Year gift. The coconut flavor is subtle and it pairs beautifully with custard, caramel and the crust. I couldn’t find Graham Crackers in my country so I used coconut biscuits instead and omit the sugar, because the biscuits are already sweet. It’s a complicated recipe, but it sure does worth it. Thanks!\nUnusually for me I followed the recipe nearly exactly, changing only the vanilla bean for a whack of vanilla paste. This pie is FANTASTIC. One of the best pies I ever tasted - made it first time yesterday for dinner company and they hoovered it like wolves, all gone. I’m an experienced home cook but not trained, and had no issues with any of the steps. Mine is full of coconut flavour so not sure why any would find it bland. Well done, Claire; I’m sure I’ll make this many times!\nAmazing. I added a layer of coconut chocolate ganache on top of the caramel (recipe from Epicurious).\nThis is literally the best pie I’ve ever had. I made this for my family and they won’t stop raving about it! The only change I made to the recipe is that I used brown butter for the pie crust, but I don’t think it made much of a difference.\nThis recipe is BOMB. And I would like to address some of the older comments about people failing at making the caramel. I had the same issues, and I tried 3 different times. The last time worked well all because I had a heavy bottom pot that held more heat and allowed the cream to incorporate into the caramel. It has to stay warm! Or it will turn to hard candy caramel and REALLY seize up!\nI never liked coconut cream pie until this recipe. I love coconut but felt most coconut cream pies were bland with little coconut flavor. I love how this recipe packs coconut into everything from the crust to the caramel to the filling. After reading the reviews, I did add a teaspoon of coconut extract to the filling which I thought was a welcome addition. Every time I’ve made it, I’ve found the coconut toasts fairly quickly (around 4 minutes). I initially burnt a few batches of coconut flakes. The crust was also on the lower end of the 12-18 for me - would just keep a close eye out. This is a fairly involved recipe and fairly time consuming. I think it’s best to make it a day ahead and keep in the fridge overnight. Best to give the filling plenty of time to set. I have made this recipe multiple times and will keep it as a standby!\ni love Claire’s Coconut Cream Pie recipe so much, i pinned it twice! i’d add more coconut to both crust and custard, but i love the simple whipped cream topping. less sweet and more creamy than the meringue i thought she was going to make, what with all those egg whites just sitting around! Claire – you are a baking genius! – so much knowledge and experience; just a great teacher! (psst – whenever there are leftover egg whites, … MERINGUE COOKIES!)\nYum! This was simply amazing! Everyone who ate it said it was the best coconut pie they’ve ever had. I personally don’t like coconut cream pie, but I loved this. Just a couple things I would mention. First I would beat the egg yolk then stream it into the food processor. Next the caramel. Like the recipe says it will seize up, don’t worry just keep stirring. I wouldn’t serve this straight from the fridge or the caramel might be a bit chewy. Just set it out for an hour or so and it’s wonderful.\nThe pie was delish! My complain would be like most, the caramel layer. It was hard and super chewy. I would adjust that for sure. Other than that the pie was delicious. Flavor was there. Coconut-y but not overpowering.\nOh Claire the things you do to me. I have made very few pies in my life. This pie was so good, even better the day after. Her caramel method didn’t work for me (which I came to accept after 2 tries) so I went with the wet caramel method and added 1/4 cup water to 1/3 cup sugar and let that caramelize which was perfect. All in all a crowd pleaser. Subtle coconut flavour but definitely there, and not too sweet. I did actually omit a bit of sugar from the custard which I could’ve eaten all of straight out of the bowl."

If you’re new to cooking these large-format classics, learning how to make baked ziti is a good place to start. It’s simpler and more forgiving than lasagna but still delivers comforting bites full of mozzarella cheese–pulls and those much coveted crunchy corners. This baked ziti recipe is designed to stay saucy. While many call for ricotta cheese, it has a tendency to get dry and grainy when baked, so we’ve swapped it for a creamy Parmesan béchamel. And in place of meatballs, ground turkey, or Italian sausage, we prefer a bit of pancetta, which adds a salty and porky hit to homemade tomato sauce without distracting from the overall composition. Despite this recipe’s name, ziti pasta isn’t mandatory. Any short, tube shape (like rigatoni, paccheri, or penne pasta) will do. Just be sure to cook it in a large pot of salted water until it is shy of al dente, since it will continue to cook in the oven. Finally, don’t skip out on broiling the whole baked ziti before serving, it’s key to a perfectly browned top. Like many baked pasta recipes, this one is hearty enough that it needs little accompaniment at the table beyond a big green salad (try this one with an Italian seasoning–inspired dressing) or some fresh veggies, and perhaps some garlic bread. Refrigerate the leftovers and enjoy them all week long."

Let pasta sit 5 minutes before serving.\nThis is always a hit. I use crushed tomatoes in order to skip the blending step.\nThis ziti tastes pretty good but is too rich for an entree. I love cheese, probably eat too much cheese, so I doubt I have ever said the following words in my life, but this recipe has too much cheese. Taste is okay but its so rich I have trouble finishing a small bowl. If you are debating trying this recipe out, consider making a half portion so you don’t have a full casserole tray to finish, or just par down the mozzarella and skip the extra time it takes to make the overly rich bechamel to opt for ricotta.\nTHE BEST pasta al forno recipe out there. You will never miss the ricotta. I feel like I’ve made this enough I can whip it up quick on a weekday night. Some tips 1) if you skip pancetta, add some extra salt to the dish 2) I get away only using 1 28oz can of crushed tomatoes…maybe it’s that extra can that makes it too “soupy.” 3) Use low moisture mozz to avoid watery spots. I also bake the dish with a foil cover, then broil uncovered. No take-out ziti will beat this gem!!!\nThis looked much like what my Mama used to cook for us… so I gave it a go. Excellent! The depth of the oven dish was not specified, so as I had already doubled the pancetta… it then became quadrupled - bcz half of the pasta missed the boat, sorry to say! I was also lazy with the Bechamel. made only half of the quantity (and used corn flour in it; to make it into a ’binding agent) and it turned out so good (still enough for 6-7)\nDelicious! Loved the way this turned out! All transparency, I SKIPPED steps 2 and 3 by using a jar of organic tomato sauce. Sacrilegious? Perhaps. Cutting out over an hour of cook time? Priceless!\nGreat bones for a ziti recipe. The Midwesterner in me substituted ground beef for the pancetta, and it worked very well. One thing to note: if you’re not an experienced cook, this recipe took 2 1/2 hours from start to plate.\nI have made this recipe numerous times and love it. i see a lot of reviews saying that it is very involved and takes a lot of time to make. I Think the first time it can seem that way but after making it so many times It comes together quickly. I actually make the marinara in this recipe by its self and jar it. My wife won’t eat spaghettis unless I use this sauce. but really it is very simple, saute some stuff add the paste and tomatoes simmer blend add basil and the sauce is done. And bechamel is easy also make rue add cheese and done…\nThis will be the 4/5 occasion I’ll be making and absolutely love it!,completely delicious. There is quite a lot of preparation and cooking time but the end result is well worth it. Highly recommended\nMy family loves this recipe! It’s quite a lot of work but worth it. It is a little saucy, so I don’t use all of the sauce. It’s a hit!\nLike some other people this recipe turned out too saucy and cheesy. I never thought that too much sauce and cheese would be a problem but it was. Very heavy and it took such a long time to make, I’m upset I didn’t like it.\nDoubled garlic, put all the parm in the bechamel (whoops!), so then added more on top. Crazy cheese and saucy! Shocking there was no ricotta! Love it!\nGood flavor but too saucy and cheesy for my taste. Would remake in my own way\nZITI GOOD. MAKE AGAIN YES. THANK U.\nThis baked ziti is soooo good. It’s a little involved but it’s a great Sunday project. The bechamel is an amazing addition that really takes this to the next level. It’s a lot of food and I’m just one person so I usually freeze half. It reheats really nicely."

    "text": "This lasagna recipe has “rainy Sunday cooking project” written all over it. But, if you’re into meal prep, you can make the cheesy béchamel and the meaty ragù ahead and pop them into the fridge or freezer. You can also assemble a tray of homemade lasagna in advance and freeze it unbaked for at least a month (and probably longer). The secret weapon is the meat sauce. You might ask: Why in the world would we tell you to make meatballs, brown them, and then break them into pieces after simmering for hours in tomato sauce? Sounds crazy, we know. Searing the meat in ball form helps you develop deep color (a.k.a. flavor) while allowing moisture to evaporate in the spaces between the balls. Mashing a bunch of ground meat into the bottom of your pot, however, would trap the steam and ultimately take longer to brown. And why do you need to crush canned whole tomatoes when crushed tomatoes are sitting right there on the grocery store shelf? We like a chunky tomato sauce, and there’s no standard for cans labeled “crushed”—they may be chunky, but they could also be a full-on purée. Better to take matters into your own hands. (Watch more of Chris’s rationalizing here.) If you want to use fresh pasta, go for it. We also tested the recipe with no-boil lasagna noodles, but found they soak up too much sauce, leading to a baked pasta that tastes dry without all that wonderful ooziness. Our ultimate pick is De Cecco lasagna sheets. This is a project recipe, to be sure. If you want to go all out, round it out with garlic bread and a classic Caesar salad.

Working in 2 batches, cook meatballs, turning occasionally and reducing heat if bottom of pot looks in danger of scorching, until browned all over, about 6 minutes per batch. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet as they’re done.\nReduce heat to medium. Add 2 oz. pancetta (Italian bacon) or slab bacon, chopped, to pot and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned and beginning to crisp, about 5 minutes. Add 1 medium onion, finely chopped, 1 celery stalk, finely chopped, 1 medium carrot, peeled, finely chopped, and 6 garlic cloves, sliced, and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened, 6–8 minutes. Add 2 Tbsp. tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until paste is darkened in color, about 2 minutes.\nAdd ¾ cup dry white wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost completely evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add one 28-oz. can whole peeled tomatoes, crushing with your hands, and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is jammy and reduced by about half, 8–10 minutes. Add 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth and 1 cup whole milk, then return meatballs to pot. Bring to a simmer. Cover pot partially with a lid, transfer to oven, and cook, checking every hour or so to ensure liquid is at a low simmer and adjusting oven temperature as needed, until meatballs are falling-apart tender, 3–4 hours.\nUsing a potato masher, break meatballs apart and incorporate into liquid (you should have about 8 cups ragù; transfer pot to stovetop and simmer gently to reduce if needed). Taste and season with more salt and black pepper if needed. Do ahead: Ragù can be made 4 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill, or freeze up to 3 months.\nMelt 7 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in ¼ cup plus 3 Tbsp. all-purpose flour and cook, whisking occasionally, until mixture smells slightly nutty, about 4 minutes. Quickly whisk in 6 cups whole milk, then increase heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer, whisking constantly. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook, whisking occasionally, until béchamel thickens, about 4 minutes. Continue to cook, whisking occasionally and adjusting heat as needed to maintain a gentle simmer, until béchamel is smooth and velvety, 8–10 minutes more. Remove from heat and whisk in 4 oz. Parmesan cheese, coarsely grated (about 1 cup), a pinch of cayenne pepper, and a pinch of ground nutmeg. (You should have about 6 cups béchamel.) Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Transfer to a large bowl and press plastic wrap directly onto surface; let cool slightly.\nPreheat oven to 325°. Cook 1¼ lb. dried lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally and separating them so they don’t stick together, until just starting to soften but still snap in half rather than bend when folded; 3 minutes is the magic number. The noodles will be so firm it will just seem all wrong, but this is what separates al dente lasagna layers from gummy ones. Using tongs, transfer noodles to a large bowl of cold water to cool. Drain and lie flat in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet, separated by parchment or wax paper.\nLightly coat a 13x9” glass or ceramic baking dish with extra-virgin olive oil. Spread 1½ cups ragù in dish. Lay a single layer of noodles over ragù (you will need to cut some noodles in half in order to fill all gaps). Spoon 1¼ cups béchamel over noodles, spreading in an even layer with a small offset spatula. Top béchamel with 1½ cups of meat sauce. Starting with another layer of noodles, repeat process, creating 5 layers of pasta (or 6, depending on how deep your pan is) in total and ending with remaining 1 cup béchamel. Lasagna should come right to the top edge of dish.\nCover with a lightly oiled piece of aluminum foil and set lasagna pan on a rimmed baking sheet (just to catch drips). Bake lasagna until bubbling gently around the edges, about 1 hour. Remove from oven. Increase oven temperature to 425° and carefully place rack in top of oven. Remove foil from lasagna and continue to bake until top is browned and crisp around the edges, 10–15 minutes longer. Let sit 10 minutes before serving. Do ahead: Béchamel can be made 1 day ahead; keep chilled. Rewarm just enough to loosen before using. Lasagna can be assembled 1 month ahead; let cool, then cover with plastic and freeze. Let frozen lasagna thaw overnight in fridge before baking."

    "text": "Comments\n\nFirst time making a lasagna with béchamel due to my wife not liking ricotta. BTW her mom makes lasagna with cottage cheese. Yuck! This is definitely a labor of love but worth the effort. I added pesto to my béchamel and it make a nice addition to this already great recipe.\nThis turned out well, it was a 2 day process and assembly felt a bit chaotic. If you make the ragu ahead of time I found it difficult to spread easily when it was cold. I recommend reheating it so the oils and juices of the tomato make it more easily spreadable. The bechamel had problems, although I found it more easily spread with my fingers than a spatula - an offset icing spatula is probably what you need. No problem with the lasagna noodles sticking although I used a store brand not de cecco. The chopping of the vegetables took 45 min (I doubled the ragu recipe to make one to stash in the freezer). I chopped my vegetables very finely and I’m glad I did, I thought of using the food processor but didn’t want to create too moisture I’d have to cook off and extend the cooking time even more.\nis everyone ok?? literally do not understand the discourse. this lasagna is very good, if you don’t think so you’re a liar or you’re bad at cooking?? sorry!!!\nThis recipe is a real winner. The second time I made this, I substituted hot Italian sausage – casing removed – for the pork, added lots of ribboned basil, and threw three cups of spinach into the ragu.\nThis recipe truly is delicious if you’re willing to put in the work. I too had an issue with the number of layers, but if you smush them down, you should be able to get at least five in a 9x13 pan.\nThis was a labour of love. Made the Bolognese one day, the bechamel the next and assembled the third day. For the Bolognese, used a pound of sweet Italian sausage and a pound of hot (casings removed). I believe my error was using fresh lasagna sheets as the end result, while it looked fantastic in the pan, did not serve as per the picture, more a sloppy mess. I think next time - and there will definitely be a next time - I will put the noodles in uncooked so they absorb the extra moisture and the lasagna will serve nicer. Mind you, our guests were close to licking their plates as they all said best lasagna ever!!! Had no issues with the bechamel as others seem to have. Did add another cup of parmesan for additional cheeseyness.\nFor those of you bad mouthing this recipe, I have been married to a first generation Italian for 42 years and this is exactly how my mother in law, grandmother in law, and all of the aunties have always made their lasagna. The family emigrated here 70 years ago and this is the recipe they brought with them. Different regions make foods differently. From North to South, there are variations on so many dishes. Don’t discount a recipe just because it’s not the way you’ve always made something.\nI can’t believe the arrogance of some of these comments! Just because it isn’t how you, your mother or nonna made it doesn’t make it wrong and certainly doesn’t mean someone isn’t a serious or even a good cook, it just means they make it differently! Here it is: lasagna with ricotta and mozzarella is a southern variation, whereas bechamel and bolognese is a northern variation. A quick Google search will help you understand that both versions coexist. My mother-in-law makes hers with meatballs, my grandfather did not. One with meat sauce, the other’s sauce without. Both were to die for! Personally, I like bechemel and bolognese, no meatballs. It make the lasagna so rich and decadent that you don’t notice the lack of ricotta. That said, I would never disparage someone who makes it differently and neither should you. Be nice! Max Mariola: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxmTu5FJP-g Marcella Hazan: https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/14/dining/cooking/lasagna-the-recipe.html\nMight be tasty but my Italian mother in law wouldn’t ever make it with bechemel or boxed pasta. Ricotta, mozzarella, Parmesan, eggs, fresh parsley and homemade pasta are absolutely essential. Her “gravy” was absolutely smooth, cooked with pork bones, meatballs, and sausages. I guess it all depends on which province a serious Italian cook originates from.\nThis is the best lasagna bolognese recipe. Chris Morocco perfected the timing, quantity, and method. I use a Staub dutch oven to cook the meatballs, and it comes out perfectly. The way they break down into a bolognese sauce is brilliant. I have also swapped out cow’s milk for cashew milk (and vegan butter) to make the bechamel sauce, as I have a friend that can’t have cow’s milk (but can eat parmesan reggiano), and there was no difference from the cow’s milk version. Even if the bechamel is not as thick as a cow’s milk version, you cannot tell when using in the lasagna. This recipe is my go to for bolognese sauce period. I will make some and freeze it to use whenever I need to pull the emergency bolognese switch.\nTastes good but a lot of work and I took shortcuts!\nThis was a lot of work, to not a great reward. I couldn’t fit all of the ragu into the pan with the number of layers called for. That was the main problem, as well as the bechamel taking much longer to thicken as others have mentioned. The end result was a pretty dry lasagna that had some nice flavor but wasn’t pleasing, considering every other lasagna I’ve had in my life. There was a particular lack of tamato flavor. It was more like ground meat with vegetable bits in pasta.\nThis recipe is perfection. I’m officially converted to bechemel lasagna. Only suggestions I’d make is salt everything really well along the way and I used quick cook noodles and put them in dry and it turned out perfectly\nI don’t know if I’ll ever be able to eat jar sauces again or buy a Stouffers Lasagna! SO delicious! Very complicated though, so if you aren’t a home “chef”:, I don’t advise trying this recipe cause you will be in the kitchen ALL. DAY. LONG. Didn’t realize before I hurriedly read over the recipe to head to the store that A) it doesn’t have ricotta cheese or mozzarella and B) it was going to take all day to make. That being said, I told my husband if it didn’t tun out, I would never try another Lasagna recipe again. Tried a homemade lasagna 10-12 years ago and it was time consuming and tasted flavorless. This lasagna recipe was absolutely worth every minute I spent in the kitchen. AND of course, like every recipe, you have to tweak it a little to make it your own. Everybody likes something different, but one thing is for sure, this bolognese rage is loaded with flavor! I did add a few more cloves of garlic because I’m a garlic lover. I did add a little mozzarella to the top after the béchamel because it didn’t feel right not have cheese on the top. I didn’t see where there were specific directions on how not to cook the noodles all the way, and I cooked the noodles all the way. That being said, I will try to do it the night way next time. It wasn’t terrible the way I made it either though. I just reduced the sauce further to thicken it since I didn’t have raw noodles to absorb it. Next time, I will likely split my time in the kitchen and cook the sauce one day and complete the meal, the next.\nThis recipe took a long time, but it was worth it. Made it with a friend and we agree, easily the best meal either of us have ever cooked. Following the instructions is really simple for a home cook and it came out better than either of us could have expected! The light spices really shine in the bolognese, the béchamel was a little bit concerning - as we were both expecting there to be more cheese and béchamel is intimidating - but it was much, much better, than any lasagna I have ever had, wether cooked by my mom or the finest restaurant (sorry mom). I cannot say enough how excellent this recipe is. Chris and the team at BA have really outdone themselves with this one. The only complaint that we have is that I wish it were somehow bigger, we inevitably will be making this with as much frequency as we can. I am no longer eager for lasagna made by any other recipe. Please do yourself a favor and make this dish, any negative comments must respectfully be the result of a mistake made by the cook. Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!"

    "text": "Comments\n\nI just love the taste and texture of these cookies. (We skip the toffee and only use chocolate chips)Our cookies never flatten out like they are supposed to, what would be the reason for that?\nThese cookies have been my go-to comfort food during the pandemic. They’re phenomenal; the brown butter makes a huge difference and using good quality chocolate wafers is so worth it. I always freeze most of the dough into portioned balls; that way, you can just bake a few at a time, and have awesome cookies whenever the need strikes.\nThese rule. In my long and illustrious career I haven’t done much baking but these RULE\nFlat flat flat flatter than pancakes!?!? HELP! I followed all the instructions, every piece on ingredient….what could have made my cookies turn out like a pancake that flattened out the the size of my hand?!? An troubleshooting advice out there?\nI’ve tried so many recipes in my life, and this one has to be my all time favorite. I dont need to make any substitutions. It’s just perfect. I make these ahead of time and freeze them for when i don’t have time or energy to make a dessert. I’ll make a few dozen and no cookie is ever left unclaimed when I set them out for loved ones. When I defrost them, I leave them on the kitchen counter uncovered for 30 minutes. They bake beautifully with the crispy edges and chewy center!\nI loved it! This was the best recipe ever but could you also include how to make the toffee because I didn’t have any at hand and had to omit it but was still AWESOME! Also, this is much better and less time consuming than the Tasty one.\nLove the detailed description, made it that much easier to get it right, my family loved it ! These cookies were so yum that they paired very well with vanilla ice cream too !!\nThese are the best cookies I’ve ever made. Every single person who’s tried them loves them. I’ve also used the same base and added different mix-ins and it’s always delicious. I’ve stopped making any other chocolate chip cookies because these are simply show stoppers\nI no longer have use for regular chocolate chip cookies in my life. These are OUTSTANDING! A huge payoff for a relatively easy recipe. Subbed 70% choc chips & Heath bits o’ brickle (bagged heath pieces without choc) because it’s what I had on hand. The browned butter took at least 20+ minutes to cool to 125 so just be mindful. If you have flaky sea salt on hand DO NOT skip that step, really pushes it over the edge. Will be making this on repeat for friends. Thanks BA!\nI cannot believe how perfect these turned out using Gluten Free AP (Pamela’s). “I would have had no idea this wasn’t a normal cookie. I’d run a mile for one of these.” are the words that my husband just spoke after I had him try one of these when I subbed in GF All Purpose Flour! And he pretty decidedly stays away from my gluten-free things. This is going to be our new go-to cookie recipe as it has both sides of the gluten-free divide VERY happy. I weighed my cookies out by 1oz and got 41 cookies (although I also went a little heavier on both chips than the recipe called for). Never browned butter for cookies before and it is SO worth it.\nI’ve made this recipe probably 5 or 6 times now; it’s become my go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe. Some tips I’ve found thru trial and error: -try not to stir the butter while it’s browning -the butter foams up when it’s getting close to done, which makes it hard to see what color it is.. I find it’s best to just do it by smell -brown butter forms little bits at the bottom.. that’s fine, they’re little caramels! -don’t skip or skimp on the creaming butter and sugar phase! Some notes: -I find a noticeable difference in the outcome when I let the batter sit for 30 minutes as recommended vs when I don’t.. letting it sit and hydrate results in a fluffier and lighter cookie, whereas baking it immediately results in a thinner more chewy cookie -the dough can of course be refrigerated, but it seems to lose some of the lovely brown butter flavor when it’s been saved -I almost always add pecans or walnuts, and that’s obviously delicious and works well -sometimes I add cinnamon or even cayenne, which is great\nThese cookies are insanely good - I have made this recipe about once a month for the last six months and each time they have turned out delicious! I highly recommend this recipe, it will be my go to for a sweet treat for years to come :-)\nThese cookies are insanely good - I have made this recipe about once a month for the last six months and each time they have turned out delicious! I highly recommend this recipe, it will be my go to for a sweet treat for years to come :-)\nThese are the best chocolate chip cookies I’ve ever made and/or eaten. I’ve made them so many times since I stumbled onto this recipe. My friends, neighbors and family thank you.\nThese cookies are DELICIOUS. Absolutely delicious. Big hit with everyone in my house, and I sent the recipe to my parents and they’re now my father’s favorite, too. I would even increase the ratio of toffee bits to chocolate; that’s literally the only thing I’d do differently, but it’s because I just really love toffee.\nI have made these cookies several times. They are my favorite, and numerous people I’ve baked them for have told me, “this is the best chocolate chip cookie I’ve ever had”- including my grandma, whose cookies were my favorite growing up! I use heath bits, and a few more grams of high quality dark chocolate than the recipe calls for. The first couple times, they came out a bit cakey (while still having excellent flavor). The third time, and every time since, I’ve done two things differently: measured by weight instead of cups, and pulled the baking sheet out mid-bake to give it a solid whack and knock down the cookies. I’m not sure which technique (or both) did the trick, but they now turn out PERFECTLY every time! Wide flat cookies, crispy at the edges and chewy at the centers; with the slight salty tang of the flaky sea salt melding perfectly with the caramelized notes from the browned butter and toffee. Mmmmmmm. Can’t wait to make them again!\nListen, I’m not playing around: these are the best cookies I have ever made in my life. There is no better cookie. The end.\nYes, these are the bomb. Dangerously so. I used 63% discs from KAF. Skor bits. I got 26 1.5 ounce cookies. One sheet at a time on middle rack. 6 per sheet. Baked 4 mins, rotated 3 mins, then dropped cookie sheet on stove top to deflate, cooked 2-3 mins more. Worked great. They must leave my house immediately.\nThis is my go to cookie recipe, the toffee really goes so well with the brown butter. I used dark chocolate wafers from ghirardelli, I do not like bittersweet chocolate. Now with PUFFY cookies…I’ve made this recipe several times already and never knew why they were puffy until recently. People have suggested to use baking soda instead of powder (recipe calls for soda so use soda). Eggs must be at room temp…didn’t make a difference to me. Batter should not be over mixed…I’ve mixed this with a hand held mixer for 10 mins to get that thick consistency and pale color, I also mixed it with a spatula and got it to a dark caramel color and loose consistency. All of this did not really have an effect. BUTTT when you’re scooping out the dough, do not roll into a ball and compact it together, just scoop and place on the tray. The denser you pack the dough, the more puffy they’ll get. Also, it depends on your oven. I place two trays in my oven, top and bottom rack. The top rack, the cookies came out nice and thin, crispy and chewy, they were perfect. Bottom rack, they did not spread out as much. The high heat really helps with the spread of the cookie as well. So just keep those two factors in mind. Either way, puffy or not they’re still delicious.\nThis was an exceptional recipe! I have made it about 10 times. The last few times I made it, the cookies puffed and didn’t spread. I just made another batch and they did spread like the original recipe. The difference between these batches was cooking by weight. When I cooked by weight, they turned out better. When I didn’t, and cooked the conventional way by cup etc, that is when they puffed up. Hopefully this helps! Keep on trying! They taste good either way.\nLove these cookies! Didn’t have access to toffee bars but had sweetened condensed milk I wasn’t going to use at home so made some condensed milk toffee which beautifully complimented the cookie. I live in a warmer climate and when I baked the cookies straight from making the dough I got beautiful spread but the next day from baking the cooled dough from the refrigerator they were puffier and more cake like. So for those with the puffy cookie recipe make sure to bake your dough from room temp.\nWhile this recipe might be “easier” that Chris’s recipe (which has more intricate steps to achieve that ‘perfect’ cookie), Rick’a cookie really seems to take the cake for the most flavorful cookie of them all. I am so impressed! The toffee Is Definetly incredible here but if you don’t like it I’m sure you could leave it out and use just a little more chocolate.\nMade these a second time and I think I have a suggestion re: puffy cookies. If you watch the video Rick uses a stand up mixer to combine the flour. Don’t do this unless you have a stand up, my hand mixer is way too powerful, even on the lowest setting so combine the flour with a spatula Instead, in the poofy cookies the flour has been overworked. Tried these with just toffee chips (100g as someone suggested) and I’d say it almost worked better than with the skor bar bits.\nThese are incredible!! If you don’t have access to Skor bars, Rick posted a Skor bar recipe to his instagram a while ago, and they’re so so amazing! Sprinkle 1/2 chopped almonds in a parchment lined pan, and in a sauce pan boil 1 cup butter, 1 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup water to 312 F, 15 min until medium amber! Then remove from heat and add 2 teaspoons vanilla. Lastly pour it into pan over the almonds and let sit for 5 minutes, then sprinkle 1 cup chopped milk chocolate and let melt and spread. Let it cool completely, and cut into pieces! This makes enough for at least 4 batches.\nTHE MOST AMAZING TOFFEE-FILLED, CHOCOLATELY, BROWN BUTTERY GOODNESS! Will definitely make again and again. You can also chop your own dark chocolate into chunks instead of using buttons, but the Skor bits is a must have!"

I sprinkled peanuts on it and a fried egg and made a meal of it and it was SO GOOD.\nNew Summer Staple I made this for a party a few weeks back. It was such a hit that I’ve had several requests for the recipe, and have made it for three other parties. I’ve made it so many times that I have it memorized.\nTis was very nice and delicious, the flavours really meshed well together"

(If it falls apart a bit, don’t sweat it.)\nMelt ½ stick butter in a small saucepan or microwave in a small bowl.\nPlace 1 3–4-lb. whole chicken on a cutting board (best to use a plastic one you can sterilize). A word on bird size. A 3–4-lb. chicken is pretty much the ideal size for roasting this way. Something a little bit bigger will work, but once you get much past 4½-lbs. it becomes harder to guarantee that the breast meat won’t dry out in the time it takes the dark meat to cook. Pat the whole thing dry with paper towels. It’s super important to get the chicken as dry as possible, which helps with browning.\nWith chicken breast facing up and legs pointing toward you, use a sharp knife to slice through loose area of skin connecting the leg and breast, making about a 3”-long incision. Continue cutting downward until you hit the joint that connects the thigh to the body, then stop (once you get through the skin, there’s not much there; if you are cutting through flesh, you’re too close to the breast). This exposes the leg joint, making it easy to tell if chicken is cooked. Repeat on second side.\nSeason every surface of chicken, including skin along backbone, inside cavity, under wings, and inside part of the leg you just exposed, with lots of salt and pepper. If you’re using kosher salt, it should take you 4–5 generous—as in, four finger—pinches, which will be around 4 whole teaspoons.\nTransfer chicken breast side up to a large oven-safe skillet. Arrange lemon and garlic cut sides down in skillet around chicken.\nDrizzle chicken all over with melted butter (mmmmmmm) and transfer to oven.\nRoast until chicken is nicely browned and cooked through, checking for doneness after 45 minutes. To check, carefully remove skillet from oven (the handle is hot!), poke a knife into leg joints, and pierce the meat. If juices run clear, the chicken is done. If you see a rosy pink color, it needs more time. Continue to roast, checking every 5 minutes, until juices run clear. (If you’re not sure, you can also use the knife to lightly shred some of the meat along the thigh bone—the meat should look opaque and the fibers should separate easily.)\nLet chicken rest in skillet at least 15 minutes before carving—this will help the juices in the meat to settle, and will also get it down to a temperature that is cool enough to handle with your bare hands while carving. Don’t worry: It’s a big piece of meat, so it will still be plenty warm by the time you serve it. Transfer chicken to a platter. Pour all of those glorious, buttery pan juices over top of the meat and serve with roasted lemon and garlic alongside. Winner, winner, chicken dinner!"

    "text": "Comments\n\nI’ve made this recipe twice now. It has become one of my favorites. I always have chicken thighs in the freezer and orzo in the pantry. And I’m happy to pick up veg on a walk in the morning. This one is a keeper in my book!\ndelicious crowd pleaser - made this for the second time tonight, and while i still haven’t followed the recipe exactly (never seem to have fennel or leeks on hand…), this recipe deserves all the praise for the risotto-style orzo prep. like other commenters, i do recommend some extra seasoning on the chicken/throughout and can see how this easily gets ‘too buttery’. first time i made it i subbed half the butter for olive oil and it was great, this time i went full butter and the orzo was phenom.\nSo Delicious! Added garlic and seasoned the chicken with italian seasoning as well. Substituted wine for apple cider vinegar as I’m not 21 yet so I couldn’t make that purchase but it was still great! Also used regular chicken broth instead of low sodium and just lessened the overall salt that gets added per taste because I just find low sodium chicken broth doesn’t have as much flavor. Overall great, family loved it and would definitely make again!\nI loved it! But I want to know: is the nutritional information of 800ish calories for all 4 servings? It seems a lot for one serving, but I don’t know how it works on BA. Not all the recipes have nutritional info! Please let me know (:\nThis is probably he best one-pot recipe I have ever made. The orzo cooked perfectly and the flavors were well-balanced. It’s definitely too rich for everyday but I will for sure be making again.\nI give the recipe four stars but I give the dish I made 5. I made a few changes: -Whole wheat orzo -Only 2 tbs butter at the beginning, did not add any at the end -I added shallots and garlic to the leeks and fennel saute -I seasoned the chicken thighs lol. With Italian seasoning, black garlic pepper, and salt Ended up with perfection.\nAnother amazing recipe! I didn’t have fennel so used celery. I also used less butter. I did end up using the amoutn of broth mentioned in the recipe (other reviews mentioned to decrease the amount) but the orzo remained quite hard, so I kept adding more. The method of making the chicken skin crispy is phenomenal!\nShould have read more of the comments and cut back on the butter. Would like to try a ‘lighter’ version of this in the future. My husband took the ‘rain salt’ part literally and I felt that between the intitial seasoning and the chicken stock, it was just too too much. Also, I’d have increased the lemon juice and decreased the stock as a flavor profile. This holds the possibility of bringing out more of the fennel and leek flavors and lowering the salty creamy? I also like the idea of olive oil for half the butter. As for the chicken, we are fortunate to have a warming drawer and used that to keep it warm while cooking part two: leeks, fennel and orzo. And this is also where my biggest criticism lies: For a one pot meal - it required a lot of standing over the pot. So this is not necessarily something I’d serve for company, nor did it allow me to enjoy my salad. This truly has to be your ONLY pot meal of the night. That, the salt, and the fatty feel from all the butter and stock are the reasons it only gets 4 stars and not 5. But the promise of fennel and leek will certainly encourage me to try again.\nThis was very yummy! I followed some advice from other reviewers and added a little bit of garlic, subbed bok choy for fennel, and used probably half a cup less of broth. If I were to make it again, I would let the skin crisp up more than the recipe says. This was my first time cooking orzo, and it was delicious!\nSo good! My family doesn’t like the taste of fennel so I subbed bok choy and it was perfect! I think some of the times were a little low-balled since my chicken and orzo both took more time than it said, but it was so worth it. I’ll definitely make this again!!\ncooking orzo as if it was risotto is a DREAM… just the orzo with whatever you want on top is an absolute winner! :) (i won’t rate it because i just followed the orzo part, but i would give it 10/10)\nHi BA & Brad Leone, This is a stunning meal, I made a few tweaks just out of necessity, and I’ll definitely cook this again. Tweaks; - swapped the orzo for par cooked lentils, freekeh & beans (soup mix) - lightly charred some broccoli with the chicken just to get some super greens! Yeah super greens! - used ghee instead of butter for the first stage My wife and I loved this dinner. Sending cheers from Rye, Victoria, Australia. Pesty\nThis recipe is a WINNER! So easy, so delicious, and hardly any clean up necessary. I have a feeling that I’ll be making this again and again.\nAmazing! Family favorite and so ridiculously easy!\nHow do you keep the chicken warm if there is still about 20 minutes of cooking after the chicken comes out of the oven?"

    "text": "Instructions\n\nStep 1 Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 300°. This is an important temperature for this recipe, so if you don’t have an oven thermometer already, now is the time to get one! Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Place on a small rimmed baking sheet. Season 1 3½–4-lb. whole chicken all over with 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt and lots of freshly ground black pepper, making sure to season the inside cavity.\nStep 2 Whisk 5 Tbsp. gochujang and ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil in a medium bowl until combined. Finely grate 3 garlic cloves (from one of the heads of garlic) into gochujang oil. Peel 1 ½” piece fresh ginger (a spoon can get the job done), then grate into gochujang oil; whisk to combine.\nStep 3 Cut what’s left of the head of garlic in half crosswise. Repeat with second head of garlic. Stuff 2 garlic halves inside cavity of chicken. Tie legs together with kitchen twine.\nStep 4 Using a pastry brush, brush half of gochujang oil over chicken.\nStep 5 Toss 1½ lb. baby Yukon Gold potatoes and remaining 2 garlic halves and 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in remaining gochujang oil until well coated. Season lightly with salt and pepper and toss again to combine.\nStep 6 Arrange potatoes in a 12” cast-iron skillet, scooting them toward edges of pan to make space for chicken. Nestle garlic halves (cut sides down) in center of skillet. Place chicken over garlic—as it roasts, it will infuse the fat (and thus, the potatoes) with flavor. If any potatoes have shimmied their way under the chicken, use tongs to arrange them around it (they won’t cook at the same rate if they’re under the chicken).\nStep 7 Roast chicken and potatoes, turning potatoes once or twice to coat in juices and oil that accumulate in pan, until potatoes are very tender when pressed with the back of a spoon, and chicken skin is deep reddish-golden brown in color, 2½–3 hours. When you wiggle the legs of the chicken, they should feel loose in the joints, meaning the meat is fall-apart tender. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and let rest 10–15 minutes. Don’t skip this step: Letting the bird rests helps the juices in the meat to settle (in other words, it makes the meat juicier).\nStep 8 Meanwhile, use the back of a large spoon or a potato masher to gently smash potatoes in skillet, exposing some of their flesh to juices underneath so they can soak them up.\nStep 9 Finish the potatoes: Thinly slice 5 scallions on a long diagonal. Cut 2 limes in half. Cut 1 half into wedges and set aside. Stir 2 tsp. honey and juice of remaining lime half into potatoes. Taste potatoes and season with more salt if needed. Scatter sliced scallions over potatoes.\nStep 10 Carve chicken, then arrange pieces over potatoes and scallions. Serve right out of skillet with remaining lime wedges alongside for squeezing, and squeeze out the sweet, slow-roasted garlic cloves as you wish. → Nervous about carving the bird? This video should help.\nStep 11 Do Ahead: Chicken can be seasoned 12 hours ahead. Chill chicken if you’re not going to cook within 2 hours of seasoning."

    "text": "Comments\n\nPretty darn tasty! Thanks\nThis is my adult children’s favorite recipe. Very juicy and flavorful. We eat it at least monthly.\nWhy is this recipe and many other BA recipes that come through email every week not on the Epicurious App? When I want to save these recipes I can’t and it is SO FRUSTRATING!\nWe usually do this recipe using just chicken thighs, and it is fantastic.\nI have made this a couple of times and it is excellent. With Christmas coming up I was thinking of trying this with a spatchcocked/halved turkey. Has anyone tried it ir have any thoughts on whether it would work? Obviously it would have some high stakes but I don’t want to have to do a test turkey!\nAll I had was skinless boneless chicken thighs and 30 minutes til dinner time, so I improvised. I made the gochujang marinade as directed but added the honey as well instead of saving it for the end. I also only had one russet potato so I diced it small, seasoned, and put them under the chicken to cook. Baked everything in a cast iron skillet at 400F for 18 minutes and sprinkled chopped green onions on at the end. Came out really tasty and tender! Great recipe that I would love to attempt more accurately in the future when I have the time\nThis came out great even though I had to roast the chicken at a higher temperature because I started cooking too late. (I did it at 375 and kept an eye on it, checked temp until the meat measured 165.) The gochujang coating blistered and blackened a bit, but still tasted good, plus the skin crisped up nicely. I might always do it that way instead of the slow-roast, honestly. We ate this on the patio on one of the first warm evenings of New England spring, and it looked fantastic on the plate, like it was straight off a Bon Appetit cover. Thoughts: - If you have an immersion blender, use that to combine the gochujang oil ingredients. - The garlic instructions are overly elaborate. Use a few cloves of garlic in the gochujang oil, skip putting it inside the chicken (doesn’t add anything), then cut a head of garlic in half to combine with the potatoes. - Ditto for the lime instructions – confusing. Squeeze a whole lime into the potatoes, try one, and add more if you need to. - The chicken is great, but don’t sleep on the potatoes. Spicy-garlicky-gingery from the gochujang oil, sweet from the honey, and tangy from the citrus – you can’t lose! Plus, if you have leftover potatoes, they are incredible with eggs the next morning.\nSo it was an insane day and by accident I spatchcocked my chicken, confusing two recipes. Cooked it anyway except high heat quickly and the chicken was so juicy flavorful great crisp carmely skin because that sauce is incredible. Fresh lime on top adds so much. Look forward to making the full recipe above.\nVery good! Dad & I loved it. For your reference: * Used 4 chicken quarters (thigh + drumstick) - took a smidge over 2 hours at 300 * Potatoes were like 90% done at 2 hours. Smashed them and put in oven at 375 while chicken rested 15 min * Used 1/2 potatoes, 1/2 sunchokes. Great. Wouldn’t use all sunchokes as they are pretty sweet, but if you’re worried about the spice it’s a great way to cut into that spice. * For a veg version, I could easily see making only with veggies (potato, sunchoke, turnip). Would avoid carrot. Rutabega - maybe? Serve with an Asian peanut noodle salad, or fried tofu cubes in either this gochugang marinade or something a little soy-shaoxing sweet/savory?\nI’ve made this as described without the squeeze of lime juice on the potatoes. all else perfect. I like lime juice on beef.\nI made this recipe exactly as written. 4 lb chicken and roasted completely by 3 hours. The garlic inside the bird I do not understand the significance. It was still raw and because of that it could not have added to flavor. The potatoes were excellent, and the chicken was very tender. My guests loved it. Next time no garlic in the bird and I may up the temp to 325 as the outside could have been browner and more caramelized. Served it with a side of Asian Slaw dressed with peanut sauce.\nthe recipe calls for 4 t honey but only 2 t are mentioned in the steps to make it\nIt was delicious, highly recommended!\nIt could just be a glitch. I’m having the same problem, doesn’t mean that Bon Appetite is trying to make us pay for a recipe. This is the first time I’ve experienced this. I just screenshot the steps… easy enough. The chicken is baking right now and smells sooo good.\nI made this recipe exactly as it was given and it was absolutely delicious. My husband said he thought it was now his favorite dish. The chicken was extremely tender ( heritage chicken was used) .The potatoes were Savory. Will be making it again. If you are making this for company it’s perfect because it will cook for 3 hours or so in the oven while you entertain and then you can just pull it out at the end and finish it"
