# Slow-Roast Gochujang Chicken

## Blurb

This isn’t the crisp-skinned, high-heat roast chicken you’re probably
familiar with. Instead, it’s a melt-in-your-mouth tender, schmaltzy,
slow-roast version that’s more similar to rotisserie chicken—except
(bonus!) it gets slathered in the funky-spicy-sweet gochujang. And while
the meat might be the star of the show, don’t discount those
buttery-soft, nearly-confited potatoes, which cook gently in the chicken
fat. Makes you wonder why you haven’t always been roasting long-cooking
vegetables—carrots, cauliflower, turnips (?!), winter squash,
fennel—under the bird for a built-in side, huh?

## Ingredients

- 1 3½–4-lb. whole chicken
- 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 5 Tbsp. gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
- ¼ cup plus 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 heads of garlic
- 1 ½” piece fresh ginger
- 1½ lb. baby Yukon Gold potatoes (about 1½” in diameter)
- 5 scallions
- 2 limes
- 2 tsp. honey

## Instructions

1.  Step 1 Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 300°. This is an
    important temperature for this recipe, so if you don’t have an oven
    thermometer already, now is the time to get one! Pat chicken dry
    with paper towels. Place on a small rimmed baking sheet. Season 1
    3½–4-lb. whole chicken all over with 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¾
    tsp. Morton kosher salt and lots of freshly ground black pepper,
    making sure to season the inside cavity.
2.  Step 2 Whisk 5 Tbsp. gochujang and ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil in a
    medium bowl until combined. Finely grate 3 garlic cloves (from one
    of the heads of garlic) into gochujang oil. Peel 1 ½” piece fresh
    ginger (a spoon can get the job done), then grate into gochujang
    oil; whisk to combine.
3.  Step 3 Cut what’s left of the head of garlic in half crosswise.
    Repeat with second head of garlic. Stuff 2 garlic halves inside
    cavity of chicken. Tie legs together with kitchen twine.
4.  Step 4 Using a pastry brush, brush half of gochujang oil over
    chicken.
5.  Step 5 Toss 1½ lb. baby Yukon Gold potatoes and remaining 2 garlic
    halves and 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in remaining gochujang oil
    until well coated. Season lightly with salt and pepper and toss
    again to combine.
6.  Step 6 Arrange potatoes in a 12” cast-iron skillet, scooting them
    toward edges of pan to make space for chicken. Nestle garlic halves
    (cut sides down) in center of skillet. Place chicken over garlic—as
    it roasts, it will infuse the fat (and thus, the potatoes) with
    flavor. If any potatoes have shimmied their way under the chicken,
    use tongs to arrange them around it (they won’t cook at the same
    rate if they’re under the chicken).
7.  Step 7 Roast chicken and potatoes, turning potatoes once or twice to
    coat in juices and oil that accumulate in pan, until potatoes are
    very tender when pressed with the back of a spoon, and chicken skin
    is deep reddish-golden brown in color, 2½–3 hours. When you wiggle
    the legs of the chicken, they should feel loose in the joints,
    meaning the meat is fall-apart tender. Transfer chicken to a cutting
    board and let rest 10–15 minutes. Don’t skip this step: Letting the
    bird rests helps the juices in the meat to settle (in other words,
    it makes the meat juicier).
8.  Step 8 Meanwhile, use the back of a large spoon or a potato masher
    to gently smash potatoes in skillet, exposing some of their flesh to
    juices underneath so they can soak them up.
9.  Step 9 Finish the potatoes: Thinly slice 5 scallions on a long
    diagonal. Cut 2 limes in half. Cut 1 half into wedges and set aside.
    Stir 2 tsp. honey and juice of remaining lime half into potatoes.
    Taste potatoes and season with more salt if needed. Scatter sliced
    scallions over potatoes.
10. Step 10 Carve chicken, then arrange pieces over potatoes and
    scallions. Serve right out of skillet with remaining lime wedges
    alongside for squeezing, and squeeze out the sweet, slow-roasted
    garlic cloves as you wish. → Nervous about carving the bird? This
    video should help.
11. Step 11 Do Ahead: Chicken can be seasoned 12 hours ahead. Chill
    chicken if you’re not going to cook within 2 hours of seasoning.

## Comments

- Pretty darn tasty! Thanks
- This is my adult children’s favorite recipe. Very juicy and flavorful.
  We eat it at least monthly.
- Why is this recipe and many other BA recipes that come through email
  every week not on the Epicurious App? When I want to save these
  recipes I can’t and it is SO FRUSTRATING!
- We usually do this recipe using just chicken thighs, and it is
  fantastic.
- I have made this a couple of times and it is excellent. With Christmas
  coming up I was thinking of trying this with a spatchcocked/halved
  turkey. Has anyone tried it ir have any thoughts on whether it would
  work? Obviously it would have some high stakes but I don’t want to
  have to do a test turkey!
- All I had was skinless boneless chicken thighs and 30 minutes til
  dinner time, so I improvised. I made the gochujang marinade as
  directed but added the honey as well instead of saving it for the end.
  I also only had one russet potato so I diced it small, seasoned, and
  put them under the chicken to cook. Baked everything in a cast iron
  skillet at 400F for 18 minutes and sprinkled chopped green onions on
  at the end. Came out really tasty and tender! Great recipe that I
  would love to attempt more accurately in the future when I have the
  time
- This came out great even though I had to roast the chicken at a higher
  temperature because I started cooking too late. (I did it at 375 and
  kept an eye on it, checked temp until the meat measured 165.) The
  gochujang coating blistered and blackened a bit, but still tasted
  good, plus the skin crisped up nicely. I might always do it that way
  instead of the slow-roast, honestly. We ate this on the patio on one
  of the first warm evenings of New England spring, and it looked
  fantastic on the plate, like it was straight off a Bon Appetit cover.
  Thoughts: - If you have an immersion blender, use that to combine the
  gochujang oil ingredients. - The garlic instructions are overly
  elaborate. Use a few cloves of garlic in the gochujang oil, skip
  putting it inside the chicken (doesn’t add anything), then cut a head
  of garlic in half to combine with the potatoes. - Ditto for the lime
  instructions – confusing. Squeeze a whole lime into the potatoes, try
  one, and add more if you need to. - The chicken is great, but don’t
  sleep on the potatoes. Spicy-garlicky-gingery from the gochujang oil,
  sweet from the honey, and tangy from the citrus – you can’t lose!
  Plus, if you have leftover potatoes, they are incredible with eggs the
  next morning.
- So it was an insane day and by accident I spatchcocked my chicken,
  confusing two recipes. Cooked it anyway except high heat quickly and
  the chicken was so juicy flavorful great crisp carmely skin because
  that sauce is incredible. Fresh lime on top adds so much. Look forward
  to making the full recipe above.
- Very good! Dad & I loved it. For your reference: \* Used 4 chicken
  quarters (thigh + drumstick) - took a smidge over 2 hours at 300 \*
  Potatoes were like 90% done at 2 hours. Smashed them and put in oven
  at 375 while chicken rested 15 min \* Used 1/2 potatoes, 1/2
  sunchokes. Great. Wouldn’t use all sunchokes as they are pretty sweet,
  but if you’re worried about the spice it’s a great way to cut into
  that spice. \* For a veg version, I could easily see making only with
  veggies (potato, sunchoke, turnip). Would avoid carrot. Rutabega -
  maybe? Serve with an Asian peanut noodle salad, or fried tofu cubes in
  either this gochugang marinade or something a little soy-shaoxing
  sweet/savory?
- I’ve made this as described without the squeeze of lime juice on the
  potatoes. all else perfect. I like lime juice on beef.
- I made this recipe exactly as written. 4 lb chicken and roasted
  completely by 3 hours. The garlic inside the bird I do not understand
  the significance. It was still raw and because of that it could not
  have added to flavor. The potatoes were excellent, and the chicken was
  very tender. My guests loved it. Next time no garlic in the bird and I
  may up the temp to 325 as the outside could have been browner and more
  caramelized. Served it with a side of Asian Slaw dressed with peanut
  sauce.
- the recipe calls for 4 t honey but only 2 t are mentioned in the steps
  to make it
- It was delicious, highly recommended!
- It could just be a glitch. I’m having the same problem, doesn’t mean
  that Bon Appetite is trying to make us pay for a recipe. This is the
  first time I’ve experienced this. I just screenshot the steps… easy
  enough. The chicken is baking right now and smells sooo good.
- I made this recipe exactly as it was given and it was absolutely
  delicious. My husband said he thought it was now his favorite dish.
  The chicken was extremely tender ( heritage chicken was used) .The
  potatoes were Savory. Will be making it again. If you are making this
  for company it’s perfect because it will cook for 3 hours or so in the
  oven while you entertain and then you can just pull it out at the end
  and finish it
