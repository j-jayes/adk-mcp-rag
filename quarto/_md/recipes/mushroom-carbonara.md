Mushrooms take the place of the traditional cured pork in this
vegetarian carbonara recipe—but fear not, the dish does not lack depth
of flavor! A deep browning on the mushrooms, coupled with garlic and
shallots, brings the humble button mushroom to a higher place.

## Ingredients

- Kosher salt
- 1½ lb. crimini or button mushrooms
- 6 garlic cloves
- 2 medium shallots
- 1 cup parsley leaves with tender stems (about ½ bunch)
- 5 large egg yolks
- 1 large egg
- 4 oz. store-bought pre-grated Parmesan, plus more for serving
- 1½ tsp. freshly ground black pepper, plus more
- ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 lb. orecchiette

## Instructions

1.  Fill a large pot with water and season well with a few big pinches
    of salt. Bring to a boil.
2.  Meanwhile, do some veg prep! Tear off and discard stems of 1½ lb.
    crimini or button mushrooms, then tear them into quarters (or in
    halves if small). Transfer to a medium bowl. Lightly smash and peel
    6 garlic cloves, then thinly slice. Peel and finely chop 2 medium
    shallots. (A small red onion will work fine in a pinch.) Coarsely
    chop 1 cup parsley leaves with tender stems.
3.  Whisk 5 large egg yolks, 1 large whole egg, 4 oz. store-bought
    pre-grated Parmesan (about 1¼ cups), and 1½ tsp. freshly ground
    black pepper in another medium bowl; set aside.
4.  Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high for a good 3 minutes. You
    want to get the pan very hot since adding the mushrooms is going to
    lower the temperature of the surface of the pan. Toss mushrooms and
    ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil once in pan to coat in oil. Cook,
    tossing once every 4–5 minutes (but mostly undisturbed), until
    mushrooms are mostly golden brown, 13–16 minutes. This will take
    some time and they will let out a lot of moisture before they start
    to brown, so stick with it!
5.  Once mushrooms have been cooking for about 10 minutes, drop 1 lb.
    orecchiette into boiling salted water and set a timer 2 minutes shy
    of al dente according to package directions.
6.  Back to those mushrooms! Once you’ve finished the browning process,
    reduce heat to medium-low and add garlic, shallots, and 1½ tsp.
    salt. Cook, stirring often, until aromatics are softened but not
    browned, 30–60 seconds.
7.  When pasta is 2 minutes shy of al dente, scoop out 2 cups pasta
    cooking liquid, then drain pasta.
8.  Add pasta along with 1 cup pasta cooking liquid to mushroom mixture.
    Cook over medium-low heat, stirring often to finish cooking the
    pasta and absorb liquid, about 2 minutes (this is why you’re cooking
    the pasta 2 minutes shy of al dente; it allows for the flavors to
    meld as the pasta finishes cooking in the sauce). Remove from heat
    and let cool 1 minute. (Don’t skip this step—if the pasta is too hot
    when you add the egg mixture, it will turn into scrambled eggs
    instead of a luxurious sauce.)
9.  Add ½ cup pasta cooking liquid to reserved egg mixture and whisk to
    combine and loosen eggs. Gradually add egg mixture to pot, stirring
    vigorously with a wooden spoon and adding more pasta cooking liquid
    as needed to loosen things up, until a very creamy, luscious sauce
    coats all noodles.
10. Add parsley and stir again to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning
    for salt.
11. Divide pasta among bowls. Top with Parmesan and a few cranks of
    pepper.
