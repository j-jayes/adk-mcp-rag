## Blurb

This lasagna recipe has “rainy Sunday cooking project” written all over
it. But, if you’re into meal prep, you can make the cheesy béchamel and
the meaty ragù ahead and pop them into the fridge or freezer. You can
also assemble a tray of homemade lasagna in advance and freeze it
unbaked for at least a month (and probably longer). The secret weapon is
the meat sauce. You might ask: Why in the world would we tell you to
make meatballs, brown them, and then break them into pieces after
simmering for hours in tomato sauce? Sounds crazy, we know. Searing the
meat in ball form helps you develop deep color (a.k.a. flavor) while
allowing moisture to evaporate in the spaces between the balls. Mashing
a bunch of ground meat into the bottom of your pot, however, would trap
the steam and ultimately take longer to brown. And why do you need to
crush canned whole tomatoes when crushed tomatoes are sitting right
there on the grocery store shelf? We like a chunky tomato sauce, and
there’s no standard for cans labeled “crushed”—they may be chunky, but
they could also be a full-on purée. Better to take matters into your own
hands. (Watch more of Chris’s rationalizing here.) If you want to use
fresh pasta, go for it. We also tested the recipe with no-boil lasagna
noodles, but found they soak up too much sauce, leading to a baked pasta
that tastes dry without all that wonderful ooziness. Our ultimate pick
is De Cecco lasagna sheets. This is a project recipe, to be sure. If you
want to go all out, round it out with garlic bread and a classic Caesar
salad. Looking for something a little lighter lift? Try our
Italian-sausage-loaded Cottage Cheese Lasagna, which blows versions made
with ricotta cheese out of the water. All products featured on Bon

## Ingredients

- 2 lb. ground pork
- 1 lb. ground beef chuck (20% fat)
- Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper
- 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 oz. pancetta (Italian bacon) or slab bacon, chopped
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 1 celery stalk, finely chopped
- 1 medium carrot, peeled, finely chopped
- 6 garlic cloves, sliced
- 2 Tbsp. tomato paste
- ¾ cup dry white wine
- 1 28-oz. can whole peeled tomatoes
- 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 cup whole milk
- 7 Tbsp. unsalted butter
- ¼ cup plus 3 Tbsp. all-purpose flour
- 6 cups whole milk
- 4 oz. Parmesan cheese, coarsely grated (about 1 cup)
- Pinch of cayenne pepper
- Pinch of ground nutmeg
- Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper
- 1¼ lb. dried lasagna noodles (preferably De Cecco)
- Extra-virgin olive oil (for greasing)

## Instructions

1.  Preheat oven to 225°. Mix 2 lb. ground pork and 1 lb. ground beef
    chuck (20% fat) with your hands in a large bowl; season generously
    with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, then mix again.
    Form into about 18 large meatballs (they don’t need to be
    perfect—you’ll be mashing them later).
2.  Warm 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a large Dutch oven or other
    heavy pot over medium-high heat. Working in 2 batches, cook
    meatballs, turning occasionally and reducing heat if bottom of pot
    looks in danger of scorching, until browned all over, about 6
    minutes per batch. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet as they’re
    done.
3.  Reduce heat to medium. Add 2 oz. pancetta (Italian bacon) or slab
    bacon, chopped, to pot and cook, stirring often, until lightly
    browned and beginning to crisp, about 5 minutes. Add 1 medium onion,
    finely chopped, 1 celery stalk, finely chopped, 1 medium carrot,
    peeled, finely chopped, and 6 garlic cloves, sliced, and cook,
    stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened, 6–8 minutes.
    Add 2 Tbsp. tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until paste
    is darkened in color, about 2 minutes.
4.  Add ¾ cup dry white wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until
    almost completely evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add one 28-oz. can
    whole peeled tomatoes, crushing with your hands, and increase heat
    to medium-high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is jammy
    and reduced by about half, 8–10 minutes. Add 1 cup low-sodium
    chicken broth and 1 cup whole milk, then return meatballs to pot.
    Bring to a simmer. Cover pot partially with a lid, transfer to oven,
    and cook, checking every hour or so to ensure liquid is at a low
    simmer and adjusting oven temperature as needed, until meatballs are
    falling-apart tender, 3–4 hours.
5.  Using a potato masher, break meatballs apart and incorporate into
    liquid (you should have about 8 cups ragù; transfer pot to stovetop
    and simmer gently to reduce if needed). Taste and season with more
    salt and black pepper if needed. Do ahead: Ragù can be made 4 days
    ahead. Let cool; cover and chill, or freeze up to 3 months.
6.  Melt 7 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a large saucepan over medium heat.
    Whisk in ¼ cup plus 3 Tbsp. all-purpose flour and cook, whisking
    occasionally, until mixture smells slightly nutty, about 4 minutes.
    Quickly whisk in 6 cups whole milk, then increase heat to
    medium-high and bring to a simmer, whisking constantly. Reduce heat
    to maintain a simmer and cook, whisking occasionally, until béchamel
    thickens, about 4 minutes. Continue to cook, whisking occasionally
    and adjusting heat as needed to maintain a gentle simmer, until
    béchamel is smooth and velvety, 8–10 minutes more. Remove from heat
    and whisk in 4 oz. Parmesan cheese, coarsely grated (about 1 cup), a
    pinch of cayenne pepper, and a pinch of ground nutmeg. (You should
    have about 6 cups béchamel.) Season with kosher salt and freshly
    ground black pepper. Transfer to a large bowl and press plastic wrap
    directly onto surface; let cool slightly.
7.  Preheat oven to 325°. Cook 1¼ lb. dried lasagna noodles in a large
    pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally and separating
    them so they don’t stick together, until just starting to soften but
    still snap in half rather than bend when folded; 3 minutes is the
    magic number. The noodles will be so firm it will just seem all
    wrong, but this is what separates al dente lasagna layers from gummy
    ones. Using tongs, transfer noodles to a large bowl of cold water to
    cool. Drain and lie flat in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet,
    separated by parchment or wax paper.
8.  Lightly coat a 13x9” glass or ceramic baking dish with extra-virgin
    olive oil. Spread 1½ cups ragù in dish. Lay a single layer of
    noodles over ragù (you will need to cut some noodles in half in
    order to fill all gaps). Spoon 1¼ cups béchamel over noodles,
    spreading in an even layer with a small offset spatula. Top béchamel
    with 1½ cups of meat sauce. Starting with another layer of noodles,
    repeat process, creating 5 layers of pasta (or 6, depending on how
    deep your pan is) in total and ending with remaining 1 cup béchamel.
    Lasagna should come right to the top edge of dish.
9.  Cover with a lightly oiled piece of aluminum foil and set lasagna
    pan on a rimmed baking sheet (just to catch drips). Bake lasagna
    until bubbling gently around the edges, about 1 hour. Remove from
    oven. Increase oven temperature to 425° and carefully place rack in
    top of oven. Remove foil from lasagna and continue to bake until top
    is browned and crisp around the edges, 10–15 minutes longer. Let sit
    10 minutes before serving. Do ahead: Béchamel can be made 1 day
    ahead; keep chilled. Rewarm just enough to loosen before using.
    Lasagna can be assembled 1 month ahead; let cool, then cover with
    plastic and freeze. Let frozen lasagna thaw overnight in fridge
    before baking.

## Comments

- First time making a lasagna with béchamel due to my wife not liking
  ricotta. BTW her mom makes lasagna with cottage cheese. Yuck! This is
  definitely a labor of love but worth the effort. I added pesto to my
  béchamel and it make a nice addition to this already great recipe.
- This turned out well, it was a 2 day process and assembly felt a bit
  chaotic. If you make the ragu ahead of time I found it difficult to
  spread easily when it was cold. I recommend reheating it so the oils
  and juices of the tomato make it more easily spreadable. The bechamel
  had problems, although I found it more easily spread with my fingers
  than a spatula - an offset icing spatula is probably what you need. No
  problem with the lasagna noodles sticking although I used a store
  brand not de cecco. The chopping of the vegetables took 45 min (I
  doubled the ragu recipe to make one to stash in the freezer). I
  chopped my vegetables very finely and I’m glad I did, I thought of
  using the food processor but didn’t want to create too moisture I’d
  have to cook off and extend the cooking time even more.
- is everyone ok?? literally do not understand the discourse. this
  lasagna is very good, if you don’t think so you’re a liar or you’re
  bad at cooking?? sorry!!!
- This recipe is a real winner. The second time I made this, I
  substituted hot Italian sausage – casing removed – for the pork, added
  lots of ribboned basil, and threw three cups of spinach into the ragu.
- This recipe truly is delicious if you’re willing to put in the work. I
  too had an issue with the number of layers, but if you smush them
  down, you should be able to get at least five in a 9x13 pan.
- This was a labour of love. Made the Bolognese one day, the bechamel
  the next and assembled the third day. For the Bolognese, used a pound
  of sweet Italian sausage and a pound of hot (casings removed). I
  believe my error was using fresh lasagna sheets as the end result,
  while it looked fantastic in the pan, did not serve as per the
  picture, more a sloppy mess. I think next time - and there will
  definitely be a next time - I will put the noodles in uncooked so they
  absorb the extra moisture and the lasagna will serve nicer. Mind you,
  our guests were close to licking their plates as they all said best
  lasagna ever!!! Had no issues with the bechamel as others seem to
  have. Did add another cup of parmesan for additional cheeseyness.
- For those of you bad mouthing this recipe, I have been married to a
  first generation Italian for 42 years and this is exactly how my
  mother in law, grandmother in law, and all of the aunties have always
  made their lasagna. The family emigrated here 70 years ago and this is
  the recipe they brought with them. Different regions make foods
  differently. From North to South, there are variations on so many
  dishes. Don’t discount a recipe just because it’s not the way you’ve
  always made something.
- I can’t believe the arrogance of some of these comments! Just because
  it isn’t how you, your mother or nonna made it doesn’t make it wrong
  and certainly doesn’t mean someone isn’t a serious or even a good
  cook, it just means they make it differently! Here it is: lasagna with
  ricotta and mozzarella is a southern variation, whereas bechamel and
  bolognese is a northern variation. A quick Google search will help you
  understand that both versions coexist. My mother-in-law makes hers
  with meatballs, my grandfather did not. One with meat sauce, the
  other’s sauce without. Both were to die for! Personally, I like
  bechemel and bolognese, no meatballs. It make the lasagna so rich and
  decadent that you don’t notice the lack of ricotta. That said, I would
  never disparage someone who makes it differently and neither should
  you. Be nice! Max Mariola: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxmTu5FJP-g

- Might be tasty but my Italian mother in law wouldn’t ever make it with
  bechemel or boxed pasta. Ricotta, mozzarella, Parmesan, eggs, fresh
  parsley and homemade pasta are absolutely essential. Her “gravy” was
  absolutely smooth, cooked with pork bones, meatballs, and sausages. I
  guess it all depends on which province a serious Italian cook
  originates from.
- This is the best lasagna bolognese recipe. Chris Morocco perfected the
  timing, quantity, and method. I use a Staub dutch oven to cook the
  meatballs, and it comes out perfectly. The way they break down into a
  bolognese sauce is brilliant. I have also swapped out cow’s milk for
  cashew milk (and vegan butter) to make the bechamel sauce, as I have a
  friend that can’t have cow’s milk (but can eat parmesan reggiano), and
  there was no difference from the cow’s milk version. Even if the
  bechamel is not as thick as a cow’s milk version, you cannot tell when
  using in the lasagna. This recipe is my go to for bolognese sauce
  period. I will make some and freeze it to use whenever I need to pull
  the emergency bolognese switch.
- Tastes good but a lot of work and I took shortcuts!
- This was a lot of work, to not a great reward. I couldn’t fit all of
  the ragu into the pan with the number of layers called for. That was
  the main problem, as well as the bechamel taking much longer to
  thicken as others have mentioned. The end result was a pretty dry
  lasagna that had some nice flavor but wasn’t pleasing, considering
  every other lasagna I’ve had in my life. There was a particular lack
  of tamato flavor. It was more like ground meat with vegetable bits in
  pasta.
- This recipe is perfection. I’m officially converted to bechemel
  lasagna. Only suggestions I’d make is salt everything really well
  along the way and I used quick cook noodles and put them in dry and it
  turned out perfectly
- I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to eat jar sauces again or buy a
  Stouffers Lasagna! SO delicious! Very complicated though, so if you
  aren’t a home “chef”:, I don’t advise trying this recipe cause you
  will be in the kitchen ALL. DAY. LONG. Didn’t realize before I
  hurriedly read over the recipe to head to the store that A) it doesn’t
  have ricotta cheese or mozzarella and B) it was going to take all day
  to make. That being said, I told my husband if it didn’t tun out, I
  would never try another Lasagna recipe again. Tried a homemade lasagna
  10-12 years ago and it was time consuming and tasted flavorless. This
  lasagna recipe was absolutely worth every minute I spent in the
  kitchen. AND of course, like every recipe, you have to tweak it a
  little to make it your own. Everybody likes something different, but
  one thing is for sure, this bolognese rage is loaded with flavor! I
  did add a few more cloves of garlic because I’m a garlic lover. I did
  add a little mozzarella to the top after the béchamel because it
  didn’t feel right not have cheese on the top. I didn’t see where there
  were specific directions on how not to cook the noodles all the way,
  and I cooked the noodles all the way. That being said, I will try to
  do it the night way next time. It wasn’t terrible the way I made it
  either though. I just reduced the sauce further to thicken it since I
  didn’t have raw noodles to absorb it. Next time, I will likely split
  my time in the kitchen and cook the sauce one day and complete the
  meal, the next.
- This recipe took a long time, but it was worth it. Made it with a
  friend and we agree, easily the best meal either of us have ever
  cooked. Following the instructions is really simple for a home cook
  and it came out better than either of us could have expected! The
  light spices really shine in the bolognese, the béchamel was a little
  bit concerning - as we were both expecting there to be more cheese and
  béchamel is intimidating - but it was much, much better, than any
  lasagna I have ever had, wether cooked by my mom or the finest
  restaurant (sorry mom). I cannot say enough how excellent this recipe
  is. Chris and the team at BA have really outdone themselves with this
  one. The only complaint that we have is that I wish it were somehow
  bigger, we inevitably will be making this with as much frequency as we
  can. I am no longer eager for lasagna made by any other recipe. Please
  do yourself a favor and make this dish, any negative comments must
  respectfully be the result of a mistake made by the cook. Amazing!
  Amazing! Amazing!
