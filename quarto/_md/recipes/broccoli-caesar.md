# Broccoli Caesar

You’ve never met a better, brighter riff on the classic Caesar than this
raw broccoli and Napa cabbage twist. Just remember that while the stems
are tender and delicious, it’s important to cut away the dried-out base
and peel the tough skin of thicker ones.

## Ingredients

- 2 oil-packed anchovy fillets (optional)
- 1 garlic clove, thinly sliced
- ¼ cup fresh lemon juice
- 2 tsp. Dijon mustard
- Kosher salt
- 1 large egg yolk or 2 Tbsp. mayonnaise
- ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 Tbsp. grated Parmesan, plus more shaved for serving
- 2 medium heads of broccoli (about 1½ lb.)
- ¼ head of savoy or Napa cabbage
- Finely grated lemon zest (for serving)
- Freshly cracked black pepper

## Instructions

1.  Using the side of a chef’s knife, mash anchovies, if using, and
    garlic on a cutting board until a smooth paste forms. Transfer paste
    to a large bowl and whisk in lemon juice, mustard, and a big pinch
    of salt. Add egg yolk (or mayonnaise) and whisk until smooth.
    Gradually add oil, whisking constantly until emulsified. Whisk in 3
    Tbsp. grated Parmesan.
2.  Trim woody ends from broccoli stems, preserving as much stem as
    possible. Peel any thick stems to expose tender inner cores. Cut off
    florets as close to the dark green flowers as possible and break
    into bite-size pieces. Add to bowl with dressing. Starting at the
    floret ends of the stems, slice very thinly crosswise and add to
    bowl. Thinly slice cabbage crosswise (you should have about 2 cups)
    and add to bowl with broccoli. Toss until broccoli and cabbage are
    combined and evenly coated with dressing; season with salt. Let sit
    10 minutes.
3.  Top salad with shaved Parmesan, some lemon zest, and a few healthy
    grinds of pepper.
4.  Dressing can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.

## Comments

- This salad was good, but the dressing was bland, which resulted in a
  dish that was tasty but not particularly unique. We enjoyed the
  texture and creativity of the raw broccoli and cabbage, but it tasted
  more like lemon/oil than caesar. If I make it again, I would make the
  dressing with another recipe.
- Excellent! Thank you! i did use less lemon juice than recommended the
  2nd time I made it.
- This was just… ok.
- I have made this several times as written and it’s great. I crave it.
  It gets better the longer it sits and is great to take to work for
  lunches. The most recent time I’ve made it I adapted it to what I had
  on hand - broccoli and green cabbage; added cauliflower that needed
  using plus carrot shaved with a peeler and thin-sliced red bell pepper
  because they’re pretty and why not. The dressing is delicious the way
  ranch is delicious because it’s really versatile.
- I had really high hopes because of the reviews–this salad was good but
  not amazing. It seemed a little overly oily/lemony to me. If I make it
  again, I may modify the recipe. It did stay crunchy for a long time
  and I agree, it was better the longer it sat.
- This salad is super good. It’s turned me on to broccoli again. Takes a
  little time to cut up all the broccoli but worth it and makes a good
  amount and as other have said, it keeps well. Definitely a keeper.
- This is really, really, really good. Stays crunchy for-ev-er. Everyone
  loved it. Will absolutely make again.
- Looks great but a bit confused on the directions, is there a typo?
  “Cut off florets as close to the dark green flowers as possible and
  break into bite-size pieces. Add to bowl with dressing. Starting at
  the floret ends of the stems, slice very thinly crosswise and add to
  bowl.”
- Finally, I’m getting enough salad in my diet! This salad is just as
  good on day three as it was on the first go. Even already dressed!
  I’ve passed the recipe on to others, and it’s become their go-to salad
  as well. To whomever came up with this… THANK YOU!
- soo yummmm, threw some fresh snap peas into the mix and thought it was
  delicious. I might use more chovy and less lemon next round though.
- This was a big hit at our Thanksgiving dinner - it even turned one
  guest that was not a broccoli fan into a broccoli lover who took home
  the leftovers to enjoy! Another winner, Chris Morocco!
- I am in love with this simple raw recipe. I used veganiase rather than
  mayonnaise and skipped the cabbage entirely. What a great way to get
  cruciferous vegetables into a meal. Satisfied my crunchy, salty.
  garlic cravings all at one and I’m not pregnant lol!
- I love caesar salad and this was delicious!! I did add croutons
  though…
- This is really really good!
- I hate most salads, but I will make anything that Chris Morocco
  recommends. Super good, especially if you let it rest for a while
  before cramming your face. I think I just ate about a pound of
  broccoli.
